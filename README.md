# Etch-a-Sketch

My Etch A Sketch project, initially a 16 x 16 grid is formed and the color of each grid element changes upon mousehover to a random rgb color, upon each 
sucessive mouse hover an extra 10% black is added to the color until after 10 hovers the color becomes completely black. 

User can form a new grid and specify their desired rows and columns by pressing the button at the top of the page which will issue a prompt asking for the 
desired columns and rows and then form this grid. The new grid will take up the same amount of space as the old one no matter the rows or columns, but it
will not accept a number for rows or columns above 100, for computer processing concerns.
